				A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
				the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
				laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent
				shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
				in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
				laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
				a puff pastry. <br />
				breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes
				possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long
				been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. <br />
				The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French
				bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
				laminated dough.In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made,
				frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that
				could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. <br />The croissant bakery,
				notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
				American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold
				in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
				Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
				countries.
